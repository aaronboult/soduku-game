# soduku-game
A web-based Soduku generator and solver using the backtracking algorithm. Bootstrap with some custom CSS was used for styling.

The purpose of this project is not to be a functional game, rather it demonstrates the limitations of generating unique, solvable puzzles at runtime using the backtracking algorithm.
